        <h2>About This Task</h2>
        <p>
            This task includes provisioning a Linux server, setting up a web server, and conveying a basic HTML landing page to exhibit specialized abilities and capacities. 
            The greeting page fills in as a model for a web application and incorporates essential data, for example, the maker's name, a task title, a concise undertaking 
            portrayal, and an individual bio. The server is arranged to permit HTTP traffic, making the page available from any program. 
            Alternatively, HTTPS can be executed utilizing a free SSL endorsement for added security.

            I once built a carbon monoxide detector to sense the gas and alert people. I'm inspired by challenges that require thinking outside the box and by people who strive to 
            make the world a better place. I believe in lifelong learning and the power of collaboration to achieve great things.
